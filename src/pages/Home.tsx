      <h1>Welcome</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my website! I document my projects and experiments here in robotics, AI, computer graphics and more in the future. This serves as a portfolio but feel free to use any code or methods. If you want to explore my computer graphics experiments I would recommend activating WebGPU flags in your browser (and use chrome if you're running linux).</p>
      <h1>About me</h1>
      I'm a CS student in France, I'm mostly interested in robotics, computer graphics, deep learning and computer vision but overall any subject that impacts the world around us in a way or another.

      Outside of more technical subjects I'm really into cooking, photography, rock climbing and many other things, so don't be surprised if you find pastries between representations learning [WIP] and ray tracing [WIP] in the experiments tab.
